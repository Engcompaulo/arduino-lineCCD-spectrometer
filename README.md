# Arduino-lineCCD-spectrometer
The purpose of this project is to develop an accessible spectrometer based
around the TCD1304AP line CCD. The data is read off via Arduino, and the data
then sent via serial USB to a computer.

The starting point for the electronics and Arduino code can be found at
David Allmon's site [here](http://davidallmon.com/pages/ccd-transmission-spectrograph)

This project uses the gEDA schematic editor to produce schematic
files.

A good comparison of possible optical setups can be found [here](http://goo.gl/bZrKdY)

Mirrors available  are 80mm (small) and 100mm (large) focal length
